# Notice
As of **MSBuild 15.8**, [RoslynCodeTaskFactory](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/blob/master/src/Tasks/RoslynCodeTaskFactory/RoslynCodeTaskFactory.cs) is now built in.  For more information, please read
[the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-roslyncodetaskfactory).  To report issues with the built-in RoslynCodeTaskFactory, please visit [https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/new](https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild/issues/new).

**You will only need to this library if you're using an older version of MSBuild.**

An MSBuild TaskFactory that uses the Roslyn compiler to generate .NET Standard task libraries which can be used by inline tasks.  It is a replacement of the built in CodeTaskFactory which uses CodeDom and does not work in .NET Core.

# Getting Started

To get started, add a PackageReference to the RoslynCodeTaskFactory package.

#### NuGet Package Manager UI
Search for `RoslynCodeTaskFactory`

#### NuGet Package Manager Console
```
Install-Package RoslynCodeTaskFactory
```

#### DotNet CLI
```
dotnet add package RoslynCodeTaskFactory
```
The package sets an MSBuild property named `$(RoslynCodeTaskFactory)` which should be used in a `<UsingTask />`.  The RoslynCodeTaskFactory is implemented exactly like the stock MSBuild [CodeTaskFactory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd722601.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) with the only difference being which `AssemblyFile` to use.

This example is the same as the one from MSDN with only the `AssemblyFile` attribute changed to use the RoslynCodeTaskFactory:
```xml
<Project ToolsVersion="12.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <!-- This simple inline task does nothing. -->  
  <UsingTask  
    TaskName="DoNothing"  
    TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"  
    AssemblyFile="$(RoslynCodeTaskFactory)"
    Condition=" '$(RoslynCodeTaskFactory)' != '' ">
    <ParameterGroup />  
    <Task>  
      <Reference Include="" />  
      <Using Namespace="" />  
      <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">  
      </Code>  
    </Task>  
  </UsingTask>  
</Project>  
```

## Hello World
Here is a more robust inline task. The HelloWorld task displays "Hello, world!" on the default error logging device, which is typically the system console or the Visual Studio Output window.
```xml
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <!-- This simple inline task displays "Hello, world!" -->  
  <UsingTask  
    TaskName="HelloWorld"
    TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"
    AssemblyFile="$(RoslynCodeTaskFactory)"
    Condition=" '$(RoslynCodeTaskFactory)' != '' ">
    <ParameterGroup />  
    <Task>  
      <Using Namespace="System"/>  
      <Using Namespace="System.IO"/>  
      <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">  
<![CDATA[  
// Display "Hello, world!"  
Log.LogError("Hello, world!");  
]]>  
      </Code>  
    </Task>  
  </UsingTask>  
</Project>  
```
You could save the HelloWorld task in a file that is named HelloWorld.targets, and then invoke it from a project as follows.
```xml
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">  
  <Import Project="HelloWorld.targets" />  
  <Target Name="Hello">  
    <HelloWorld />  
  </Target>  
</Project>  
```
